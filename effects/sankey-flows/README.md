# Sankey flows (`sankey-flows`)

Wide soft ribbons in the palette colours slowly flow from left to right, splitting and merging as on a Sankey diagram.

- **Russian name:** Потоки Санки
- **Version:** 0.1.0, simai.effect 1.4.0
- **Surfaces:** hero, section, dashboard, sign-in
- **Tags:** chart, ribbons
- **Role:** A background about data and resources in motion: budgets, traffic, processes. Also works simply as a calm colour background. Both schemes.

## Settings

| Key | Type | Range or options | Default | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `speed` | integer | 10–300 % | `100` | Speed |
| `intensity` | integer | 10–100 % | `70` | Intensity of the drawing |
| `flows` | integer | 3–9 | `6` | Flows |
| `palette` | choice | `theme`, `turquoise`, `ocean`, `violet`, `rose`, `emerald`, `sunset`, `gold`, `silver`, `custom` | `"theme"` | Palette. `theme` follows the theme colour; the others stay as they are |
| `colour` | color | hex | `"#3b82f6"` | Colour, read only while `palette` is `custom`: the effect builds every tone from it |
| `interactive` | boolean | | `true` | React to the pointer: the flow under the pointer brightens along its whole path |

## Schemes

The manifest declares `"schemes": ["light", "dark"]`, and `"capabilities": ["windows"]`.

Draws in both schemes: **light** (home, the default) and **dark**. Each scheme is designed from its own palette tones; it is not an inverted picture.

Theme modes a placement may choose: `auto`, `dark`, `light`.
